# How to Contribute Documentation

Up-to-date, accurate and thorough documentation is as important as the code.
We encourage and welcome contributions to the documentation.  Please make
sure to follow these simple guidelines.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Updating Documentation

For a small update (examples: fixing a typo, updating a dead link), just create a PR and have it reviewed.

For a larger update (examples: documenting a new feature, rewriting an entire page for better comprehension),
file a [documentation request issue](https://github.com/grafeas/kritis/issues/new?template=doc_request.md),
and as you create PRs, make sure to associate them to this issue.

## Requesting an Update

Please file a [documentation request issue](https://github.com/grafeas/kritis/issues/new?template=doc_request.md)
describing your request.
